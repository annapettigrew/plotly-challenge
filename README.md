I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The plots that are in this dashboard, include: 
- A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- A bubble chart that displays each sample.
- The sample metadata is displayed, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- A key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.
- The plots will update  when a new sample is selected.

The results will be deployed on GitHub Pages
